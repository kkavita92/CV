After a degree in Economics and a law conversion, I stumbled into programming. 

My involvement in various university societies has given me extensive experience in project management and event organisation while my highly analytical Economics degree has allowed me to .... 


I am excited about any new opportunities, particularly challenging ones.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communication 

I am a strong communicator, as demonstrated in my years as a LSE Student Ambassador, during which I had to conduct regular university tours and facilitate workshops run by the Widening Participation team. Subsequently, I was awarded Delegate of The Year for my ability to articulate myself in a concise, yet engaging way. 

<b>Some other ways I have honed this skill:</b>

* Selected to mentor at [Codecademy London](https://www.meetup.com/Codecademy-London/) which requires breaking down complex coding concepts into understandable chunks.
* Represented LSE at Model United Nations conferences and have won Best/Highly Commended delegate awards. 
* Hosted a radio show with [LSESU PuLSE](http://pulselse.co.uk/) which tackled different societal issues weekly. 

#### Strong Leadership 

I have held several leadership positions through university - namely President of the 600-strong Model United Nations Society. 
I was able to create and implement a bolder vision for the society during my year stint, launching several programmes which still remain in place three years on. As President, I accomplished the following: 

* Managed a 30 member committee with 5 sub-committees.  
* Held more than 20 events through the year including speaker event with Sir Jeremy Greenstock.
* Created first ever [UK MUN competitive team](http://www.lsesuunsoc.com/teamlse/) and training programme and obtained funding for it worth £4000.
* Set up [Outreach branch](http://www.lsesuunsoc.com/outreach) for society which supported organisations such as UNHCR, WFP and UNRWA.
* Initiated inaugural [LSE Youth conference](http://www.lsesuunsoc.com/youthmun-conference-2017/) which made profit of £468 for society.
